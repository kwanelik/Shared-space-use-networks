# Shared-space-use-networks
R code and data for Wanelik and Farine 2019 (bioRxiv, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/839530) demonstrating how to apply our method and how to replicate our simulations. 

Our method allows more meaningful shared space use networks to be generated from sparse point-based observations of individuals (data commonly available for small or crypytic species).
